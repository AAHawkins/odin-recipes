    <h3>
      An antipasto is a cold platter of meat, cheese, and vegetables which is
      served at the start of a meal before the pasta and other courses, but to
      save some time, I thought we'd add the pasta right into the antipasto to
      turn into a complete meal all by itself. You could serve this as a side
      dish, but with a hunk of crusty bread and a glass of wine, I'm not sure
      what else you'd need. Top with more parsley before serving.

    <ul>
      <li>1 clove garlic, finely crushed</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>For the Salad:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup julienned red onion</li>
      <li>⅓ cup julienned jalapeno pepper</li>
      <li>⅓ cup julienned pickled pepperoncini peppers</li>
      <li>½ cup julienned fire-roasted red pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup quartered baby artichoke hearts</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced black olives</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced green olives</li>
      <li>¼ pound salami, julienned</li>
      <li>¼ pound pepperoni, julienned</li>
      <li>3 ounces deli-style ham, julienned</li>
      <li>¼ pound provolone cheese, julienned</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the
        boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
        about 12 minutes. Drain thoroughly in a colander, but do not rinse; stir
        to release heat. Allow to cool in the colander for 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While pasta cools, add garlic and anchovy to a large mixing bowl. Use a
        whisk or fork to crush the anchovy and garlic into a paste. Add Dijon
        mustard, mayonnaise, vinegar, salt, pepper, oregano, and thyme and whisk
        to combine. Slowly drizzle in olive oil, whisking constantly, until
        dressing is smooth, thick, and coats the back of a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour cooled pasta into the bowl of dressing and toss with a large spoon
        until well coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir red onion, jalapeno, pepperoncini, red pepper, artichokes, black
        olives, green olives into the salad. Add salami, pepperoni, and ham; mix
        thoroughly. Add Provolone cheese. Mix with a spoon thoroughly to
        combine. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, 3 to
        12 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the refrigerator, add chopped parsley and tomatoes, and mix
        thoroughly. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed.
